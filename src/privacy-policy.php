	<h1>Consumer Information Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>Inquirehire respects your concerns about maintaining the privacy of non-public personal information (NPI) data submitted to us by clients in connection with the employment background and credential verification services that Inquirehire provides. The privacy policy covers all information that we collect including the data we collect from third parties and other sources in connection with the services that we provide. All data will be collected, stored and used in compliance with applicable law, which may include the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and other state and federal laws.  This notice explains why we collect NPI, what we do with NPI, and how we protect your privacy.</p>

	<h2>Collecting Information</h2>

	<p>We collect NPI about our customers and individuals to provide them with investigative and pre-employment screening services.  This may include telephone number, address, date of birth, Social Security number, occupation, employment information, and financial information.  We may receive NPI from your applications and forms, other businesses, and other service providers.</p>

	<h2>Intended use of Information</h2>

	<p>Our clients provide us with personal information in connection with the collection & preparation of data reports. Such personal information may include employment history and other credentials related to the prospective employment with our clients. Inquirehire will use such information only for the purpose of performing pre-employment screening and credential verification services, including to verify the accuracy of the personal information and to check on references. In addition to the data that is submitted to Inquirehire by our clients, Inquirehire may collect data from third parties, such as contact information, public records, biographical information, credit and other lawful checks. Inquirehire may prepare interview notes, comments from references and a record of our contact with individuals. Inquirehire will provide all such information to our clients in one or more reports.</p>

	<h2>Sharing Information</h2>

	<p>We share the types of NPI described above primarily with people who perform research of public records and other professional investigative services in order to fulfill investigative requests.  We may occasionally share information with professional services that may help us to collect fees, make payments or detect fraud.  The organization may retain the NPI and disclose it to others for whom it performs services.  We may also share NPI when otherwise required or permitted by law, such as sharing with governmental or other legal authorities.  When legally necessary, we ask your permission before sharing NPI about you.  Our practices apply to our former, current and future customers. </p>

	<p>Please be assured we do not share your NPI to market any product or service.</p>

	<p>When other companies help us conduct business, we expect them to follow applicable privacy laws.  We do not authorize them to use or share NPI except when necessary to conduct the work they are performing for Inquirehire or to meet regulatory or other governmental requirements.</p>

	<h2>Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas</h2>

	<p>Inquirehire opposes the “offshoring” of NPI of consumers – such as names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (SSNs) – sent overseas outside of the United States and its territories and beyond the protection of U.S. Privacy laws. Inquirehire believes consumers are best served by keeping all such information in the United States.  Inquirehire is a member of  ConcernedCRA's (http://www.concernedcras.com/) a group of Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRAs) dedicated to protecting consumer privacy by not offshoring NPI.   Inquirehire has adopted the policy of ConcernedCRA’s and operates in as follows:</p>

	<p>Domestic Background Screening: Where a CRA (background screening firm) is providing background screening services for consumers in the United States based upon information available in the U.S., a firm displaying the ConcernedCRA seal certifies that it does not send data outside the U. S. or its territories for processing or preparation of a background check report or for any other reason. All work is done in the U.S. </p>

	<p>International Screening: Where there is an international background check for verification of employment, education, or a professional degree, or for a criminal record check, some information may have to go offshore by necessity since the information being sought is offshore. However, firms displaying the ConcernedCRA seal have taken measures to protect personal and confidential data: a.) Documentation or information such as passport numbers, or unique identification numbers and date of birth, are not sent to anyone overseas other than the actual verification provider (e.g. employer or school registrar) whenever possible. b.) Where it is necessary to utilize a local firm, the local firm will first be asked to provide local contact information so that the CRA can contact the foreign verifying party directly. c.) If, due to infrastructure or other issues in a foreign country, a foreign research firm must perform the verification, then the CRA or its agent has properly vetted the local firm, and will redact any unnecessary information. </p>

	<p>Where a CRA utilizes a third party service to perform domestic or international services in connection with providing background reports, firms that adopted this standard have made reasonable inquires to ensure that any provider is also following the ConcernedCRA standard. </p>

	<h2>Safeguarding Information</h2>

	<p>Inquirehire will take all appropriate measures to assure the security of personal data. Inquirehire web site and any data transmitted to or from it are protected by a secure socket layer (SSL) which encrypts the data. All data that is stored on our systems is accessible only to our authorized personnel, those of which have been trained to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure of personal data under Inquirehire control. Our location has an onsite security system that enables physical entry only by an electronic identification badge and we have implemented multiple policies concerning the safeguarding of information. We value our knowledge in our technology and our security policies. </p>

	<p>Inquirehire requires disposal practices that are reasonable and appropriate to prevent the unauthorized access to or use of NPI.  Inquirehire uses reasonable measures for disposing of hard copy and electronic NPI that meets the standards of the National Association for Information  Destruction (NAID).</p>

	<h2>Access to Information</h2>

	<p>You may request access to certain NPI we collect to provide the investigative and pre-employment services.  You must make your request in writing and send it to the address below.  The letter should include your full name, address, and telephone number.  If you request, we will send copies of the NPI to you.  We may charge a reasonable fee to cover our copying costs.  </p>

	<h2>Correction of Information</h2>

	<p>If you believe NPI we have about you is incorrect, please write to us.  Your letter should include your full name, address, and telephone number.  Your letter should also explain why you believe the NPI is inaccurate.  If we agree with you, we will correct the NPI and notify you of the correction.  We will also notify any person who may have received the incorrect NPI from us in the past two years if you ask us to contact that person.</p>

	<p>If we disagree with you, we will tell you we are not going to make the correction.  We will give you the reasons for our refusal.  We will also tell you that you may submit a statement to us.  Your statement should include the NPI you believe is correct.  It should also include the reasons why you disagree with our decision not to correct the NPI in our files.  We will file your statement with the disputed NPI.  We will include your statement anytime we disclose the disputed NPI.  We will also give the statement to any person designated by you if we may have disclosed the disputed NPI to that person in the past two years.  </p>
