Inquirehire helps employers find and attract better job candidates for their job openings with the ApplicantList recruiting and tracking system. ApplicantList is a flexible cloud-based system that fully automates the hiring process. Employers can attract top candidates with several key system features.

### Branded Career Website and Online Employment Application

ApplicantList provides a custom branded career site, designed to mimic the color scheme and branding of your corporate website.  We’ll have your customized site ready to use in no time, without any help from your marketing or IT team. Plus, your career site can be easily managed and maintained by your HR staff without any html or programming knowledge.

Each career site comes with its own customizable employment application designed to meet your specific needs.  This includes the use of your employment disclosure text, job specific screening questions, and ensures proper collection of voluntary disclosure information.  To validate receipt of the application, each applicant will automatically receive a custom thank-you email upon completion of their application.

### Automated Job Board Posting & Social Media Integration

Our ONEPOST tool allows you to quickly take the job openings on your ApplicantList careers site and upload them to multiple posting sites with just one click. This includes thousands of free job boards, paid job boards, state and local workforce agencies, diversity sites, as well as social media and search engines.

Looking to leverage the power of social media to further expand your applicant pool?  Our integrated tools will ensure you get the most from social network sites, without even lifting a finger.  This includes the ability to connect with job seekers by allowing them to share jobs with their friends through Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

### Powerful Job Tracking Audit Tools

Our powerful job tracking section will ensure compliance with OFCCP job posting rules.  Not only does it track each job posting, including date posted, duration, and amount paid, but it can also store a link or screen shot of the job posting as proof for audit tracking purposes.

### Powerful Screening and Tracking

Collecting applications is only the beginning. ApplicantPro makes it easy for you to screen through even the largest applicant pool.  Applicants will be scored and ranked based on the job screening questions and applicants who don’t meet your minimum qualifications will be automatically flagged as disqualified. You can even send out mass email messages to groups of applicants, such as rejection letters.

### Automated Applicant Log Report

Tired of manually tracking your Applicant Flow Log in spreadsheets?  Our system will automatically combine all of your application data and tracking information into a customizable applicant log report.  This report can be printed or exported into a csv file, such as Excel, at any time and for any date range.

### Unlimited Manager Logins

Unlimited manager logins are included that provide various levels of restricted access to our system.  Your managers can see only the applicants that you want them to work with, and have restricted access to the system functionality.  As a manager moves an applicant through the hiring process, ApplicantPro will track them each step of the way, including automatically adding the proper disposition codes to your applicant log report.
