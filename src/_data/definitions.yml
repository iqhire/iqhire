Another example would be a county with a computer index that extends only 5 years back; then another microfiche index which extends from 5 to 10 years back; and a card index that extends 10 to 25 years back.

- term: "Strong Password"
  definition: "A password that is difficult to detect by both humans and computer programs, effectively protecting data from unauthorized access. A strong password consists of at least six characters (and the more characters, the stronger the password) that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are typically case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase. Strong passwords also do not contain words that can be found in a dictionary or parts of the user’s own name."
