2. A record that is not readily available due to court access barriers.

It should be noted that records which are readily available individually, or in smaller quantities, can nonetheless be more difficult to access collectively, or in larger quantities, by virtue of court imposed record access barriersâ€”such as file-pull limitations (e.g., the court only allows 5-10 file-pulls per provider per day), viewing time limitations (e.g., the court only allows 1 hour of file-viewing per provider per day), et cetera.
