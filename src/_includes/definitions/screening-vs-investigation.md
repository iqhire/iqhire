“The difference between screening and investigation is analogous to the difference between giving cholesterol tests to a large number of consumers for a medical risk factor for heart disease, versus doing an exploratory surgical procedure one patient at a time. Obviously an exploratory procedure is much more reliable, but it is also intrusive, time consuming and expensive. Of course, when giving merely a cholesterol test instead of performing exploratory surgery, it is possible that someone with a serious condition might slip through the cracks and have a more serious condition than indicted. However, the cost must be weighed against the benefit of faster, less expensive and less intrusive procedures that have an excellent detection rate on a greater number of people.”

Research for the purpose of screening conventionally entails a seven to ten year search scope.
