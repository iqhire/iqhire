The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1996 required the establishment of programs to combat healthcare fraud and abuse. As a part of the program, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was given the authority to levy civil monetary penalties against entities that submit claims for healthcare services rendered by employees or contractors whom they know, or should know, have been excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. Penalties can be as high as $10,000 per infraction. Three infractions can lead to permanent exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, the OIG can impose an assessment of three times the amount claimed.
