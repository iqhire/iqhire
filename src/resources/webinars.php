		<h3>Advanced Employment Screening – Social Media</h3>
		<p>Why should I consider social media screening as part of our pre-employment screening protocol? Social media screening can reveal applicant behavior that may be embarrassing or damaging to your organization. Many organizations use internal resources to conduct some form of social media screening, but this can be time-consuming, yet incomplete and inconsistent. In this webinar we will discuss a more effective approach to social media screening that is also comprehensive and compliant.</p>

		<h3>Advanced Employment Screening – Professional Reference Checks</h3>
		<p>Historically 40% of candidates falsify their work history by embellishing responsibilities or accomplishments. Most employers will not provide non-neutral reference information to prospective employers. As a result, a critical “blind spot” can exist for many job applicants. In this webinar we will discuss a solution that will produce 3 or more professional references in 1 or 2 business days without time-consuming, fruitless phone calls.</p>
