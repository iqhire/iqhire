Inquirehire has provided background investigations for Iowa School Districts for over 10 years.  We are thoroughly familiar with the state requirements for teachers, bus drivers, contractors and volunteers. [See Iowa Requirements](/assets/files/schools/iowa-background-check-requirements.docx).

## Pricing

Inquirehire is cognizant of the fact that school districts are facing economic difficulties.  Therefore we have aggressive pre-built Iowa School packages that meet all requirements.

## Specialty Features

Inquirehire has features available that are advantageous to school districts to expedite the background process:

 - **QuickApp**  
   Employees or candidates can be sent a link to sign a Disclosure &amp; Authorization form electronically.  Saves time and effort especially for those remote candidates. [Learn More](/about/contact.html).

 - **Batch Ordering**  
   When multiple reports are needed, HR departments have the ability to upload a spreadsheet containing all the names and personal identifiers as oppose to data entering each name. [Learn More](/about/contact.html).

 - **Vault Verify**  
   A NO COST service that handles your employment verifications which saves time and money for HR departments.  In fact, Vault Verify pays the school district each time a verification is made. [Learn More](/about/contact.html).
