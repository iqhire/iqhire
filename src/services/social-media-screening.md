title: Social Media Screening
---

Traditional background checks protect employers by revealing an applicant’s past behavior. Social media screening provides additional protection by revealing an applicant’s current behavior. The Inquirehire social media screen can identify several areas of concern for employers including violent activity, illegal activity, racism/intolerance, and sexually explicit material. Social media screening is offered in 3 levels to suit each employer’s specific needs; basic, comprehensive, and executive.

The Inquirehire social media screening service utilizes advanced technology to search more than 200 websites for information based on each employer’s specific criteria. A trained analyst then reviews all material for job relevance before finalizing the report, which normally takes 48 hours to complete. 

Studies indicate that many employers already conduct their own social media checks on employment candidates. But the use of internal resources puts the employer at risk because they cannot “unsee” protected class information. The Inquirehire social media screening service redacts protected class information so the employer is protected. This service has been reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission and has been certified to be compliant with the FCRA and Title VII.
