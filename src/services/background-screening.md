### Social Security Number Verification

The search may reveal a simple clerical error, or a more serious problem such as identity theft. If the search does not reveal a valid social security number, the remaining search elements will be held until the social security number can be verified.

### Social Security Number Trace

Once all jurisdictions have been identified the client will have the option to extend criminal or civil searches to additional counties which have been identified. If there is a significant different between the applicants reported jurisdictions and the social security trace results, it may indicate a problem which should be investigated further.
