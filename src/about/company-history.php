		<p>In 1997, Inquirehire was established as a resource for those employers with a desire to identify high risk candidates with thorough, fast, and compliant background investigations.  It became Inquirehire’s mission to help employers avoid costly mistakes of a bad hiring decision.  Inquirehire has since evolved into an organization that helps manage and automate the entire hiring process while delivering the solutions that eliminate risk.</p>
		<p>A leader in the industry, Inquirehire was a founding member of the National Association of Professional Background Screeners (NAPBS). In 2007, Inquirehire launched one of the nation’s finest pre-integrated applicant tracking and background screening solutions. In 2013 Inquirehire became an NAPBS Accredited firm.   This recognition stands as the industry “seal” representing a background screening organization’s commitment to excellence, accountability, high professional standards and continued institutional improvement.</p>
