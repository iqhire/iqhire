In 1997, Inquirehire was established as a resource for those employers with a desire to identify high risk candidates with thorough, fast, and compliant background investigations.  It became Inquirehire’s mission to help employers avoid costly mistakes of a bad hiring decision.  Inquirehire has since evolved into an organization that helps manage and automate the entire hiring process while delivering the solutions that eliminate risk.

A leader in the industry, Inquirehire was a founding member of the National Association of Professional Background Screeners (NAPBS). In 2007, Inquirehire launched one of the nation’s finest pre-integrated applicant tracking and background screening solutions. In 2013 Inquirehire became an NAPBS Accredited firm.   This recognition stands as the industry “seal” representing a background screening organization’s commitment to excellence, accountability, high professional standards and continued institutional improvement.

With the Inquirehire solution employers can transform and optimize their hiring process to save time, money, and avoid hiring mistakes.
