			<dt><a name="">Adjudication</a></dt>
			<dd>The ability to automate a judgment based on background screening outcome. This judgment often results in “meets requirements” or “does not meet requirements” outcome. Once adjudication takes place automatic distribution and/or adverse action can occur.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Adjudication Withheld – Non-conviction</a></dt>
			<dd>The court does not give a final judgment regarding the case. The defendant is given probation, a program or community service in which they have a specified amount of time to complete. If the defendant complies, the case may be dismissed, depending on the county/state. If they do not dismiss in that particular county / state, then the disposition remains adjudication withheld and the case is closed. However, if the defendant is found in violation, the case disposition may be changed and the defendant can be found guilty.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Admitted Record</a></dt>
			<dd>A record the subject has admitted to having. Admitted record information can prove valuable for the research provider in conducting a search, and ideally customers would include any such information up front with their search requests as matter of course.</dd>

			<dd>To mention a record or possible record means just that: to merely mention or disclose, in writing, the fact of its existence to the customer, as opposed to providing a formal record report on it. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Misdemeanor</a></dt>
			<dd>A lesser crime punishable by a fine and/or county jail time for up to one year. Misdemeanors are distinguished from felonies, which can be punished by a state prison term.

				<ol>
					<li>A record that is not readily available compared to other more readily available records in the same court or public records agency;</li>
					<li>A record that is not readily available due to court access barriers.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>It should be noted that records which are readily available individually, or in smaller quantities, can nonetheless be more difficult to access collectively, or in larger quantities, by virtue of court imposed record access barriers—such as file-pull limitations (e.g., the court only allows 5-10 file-pulls per provider per day), viewing time limitations (e.g., the court only allows 1 hour of file-viewing per provider per day), et cetera. </p>

			<dt><a name="">Offender</a></dt>
			<dd>A consumer with a criminal record.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Partial Name Match Only</a></dt>
			<dd>Only a partial match of the subject’s name is established—with no additional matching identifiers also established, such as a DOB, DLN or SSN (see Matching Logic). </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a></dt>
			<dd>“Personally identifiable information”, or “personally identifying information”, is any piece of information along with the consumer’s name which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact or locate a single person.

			<dt><a name="">Prayer for Judgment – Non-conviction</a></dt>
			<dd>Often seen in North Carolina, it falls under deferred prosecution, meaning the state did not prosecute. For example, with worthless checks it gives the defendant a chance to pay the check before being charged.</dd>

			<dt><a name="">Pre-employment screening</a></dt>
			<dd>Pre-employment screening services can include background screening, drug screening, skills assessment and behavioral assessment. A thorough background screen verifies important factual information about a prospective employee (i.e. identity, employment history, education credentials). It also helps gain critical information about an applicant’s character and past history that isn’t always apparent in an interview or application, such as criminal history, credit history, and driving record. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Pre-indexed</a></dt>
			<dd>A search request on a subject who has been pre-indexed has been pre-researched by the requestor, the requestor’s customer, et cetera, on either the same index (or some version thereof) that the provider is now being requested to search. While a pre-indexed search does not necessarily equate to prescreening (e.g., see salted search), all prescreened searches have by definition been pre-indexed. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Predominantly Used Index (PUI)</a></dt>
			<dd>That portion or portions of a county’s index at the Central Court which is commonly considered adequate to use exclusively in performing a Common Search. For example, in a county with three separate criminal index sections—such as: a section of the felony/misdemeanor index on computer which extends 10 years back; another section of the felony/misdemeanor index on microfiche which extends from 10 to 20 years back; and a felony-only index that extends 60 years back—only that 10 year section of the felony/misdemeanor index on computer would constitute the Predominantly Used Index, if indeed it is the section of public index predominately and exclusively used by the local research community to perform a Common Search in that county. Another example would be a county with a computer index that extends only 5 years back; then another microfiche index which extends from 5 to 10 years back; and a card index that extends 10 to 25 years back. The 5 year computer index plus the 5-10 year microfiche index would constitute the Predominantly Used Index, if indeed those are the sections of public index predominately and exclusively used by the local research community to perform a Common Search in that county. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Prescreened Search</a></dt>
			<dd>Any search on a subject that has been prescreened from a greater group of subjects, with the intent being to eliminate from that original group most or all subjects with Negative Results, so that only subjects with Positive Results need be submitted to the provider. If a subject has been prescreened the customer is fully expected to disclose the fact up front. A prescreened search is not to be confused with a salted search, or with a regular search on a subject who has admitted to having a record. (The customer’s inclusion with a regular search request of any additional information on the subject, obtained my means other than prescreening and simply meant to aid the provider in performing their search, would not constitute a prescreened search). </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Prescreening</a></dt>
			<dd>See Prescreened Search. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Process Server</a></dt>
			<dd>The individual engaged to give legal notice to a person (defendant etc.) of a legal proceeding involving them, so as to enable that person to respond to the proceeding before the court. Usually the notice is furnished by delivering a set of court documents to the person to be served. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Pursue</a></dt>
			<dd>To pursue a possible record means just that: to pursue or further research it in order to discover more about it. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">QuickApp</a></dt>

			<dd>See Research Providers</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Regular Search</a></dt>
			<dd>A search on a subject that has not been pre-indexed for any reason. A regular search is not to be confused with a prescreened or salted search. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Regularly Incurred Mandatory Court Fee(s)</a></dt>
			<dd>Any mandatory court fee regularly incurred by the research provider on behalf of their customer—e.g., a mandatory court clerk search fee regularly imposed by a court which does not allow direct public access to its index. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Reportability</a></dt>
			<dd>See Reportable</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Reportable</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<ol>
					<li>Refers to which results can be legally reported to an End-User—the standard being whether the information complies with applicable law, such as the FCRA and state consumer reporting laws;</li>
					<li>From a Research Provider’s perspective, unusable records are typically considered or referred to as “unreportable” in the context of a criminal search (unless specifically negotiated for by their customer).</li>
				</ol>
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Research Provider</a></dt>
			<dd>Research Providers for the Background Screening Industry are classified as follows: In-court, Regional, National and International. An In-Court Provider performs research directly, whether the region they directly cover is comprised of one county or five. A Mom & Pop would be considered an In-Court Research Provider so long as they perform research directly. A Regional Provider utilizes one or more In-Court Providers to cover any size region short of an entire nation. By contrast, a Mom &amp; Pop who hire one or more In-Court Providers to cover any portion of their region would re-classify as a Regional Provider. A National Provider utilizes In-Court and/or Regional Providers to cover an entire nation. An International Provider utilizes any of the above to provide coverage internationally. A Research Provider is not considered a Consumer Reporting Agency. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Reseller</a></dt>
			<dd>A CRA (generally an employment or tenant screening firm) who is purchasing data wholesale and is providing it to the end-user for the purpose of making an employment or rental decision under the FCRA.</dd>

			<dt><a name="">Responsible – Non-conviction</a></dt>
			<dd>The defendant is responsible for the payment of the fines or fees of the crime. They are not found in guilt, however, must pay what they are ordered. Often found on traffic tickets or minor violation. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Result</a></dt>
			<dd>Either the outcome of an index check on a subject (Index Result); the record information obtained on a subject (Case or Record Result); or both. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Retail Screening Company</a></dt>
			<dd><p>A company that conducts background checks using public records and other information to furnish a consumer report for an End-User (i.e. employer or property owner), in which capacity it must comply with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), under which a Retail Screening Company is considered a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA). It is the ultimate responsibility of the screening company to ensure any information they provide to an End-User is in compliance with the FCRA and any other applicable consumer reporting laws (see NAPBS Criminal Research Provider Guideline #20). </p>

			<dt><a name="">Record Retrieval Request</a></dt>
			<dd>A request to retrieve case information, copies, et cetera on a record that is known to exist by the customer. In that a provider’s default search product rate is typically based on a regular search, it should be fully appreciated that the provider has a right to surcharge for a record retrieval request. A prescreened search that has been submitted in the guise of a regular search is nonetheless a record retrieval request in fact, and the provider has the right to surcharge their customer accordingly for it. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">§1681s-2</a></dt>
			<dd>This designation references the section of the FCRA entitled “Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies”. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Salted Search</a></dt>
			<dd>A search on a subject that has been otherwise pre-indexed and found to have a legally reportable record, and as a quality assurance measure is now being requested of the unwitting provider in order to test their ability to discover and accurately report the known record. A salted search is not to be confused with a prescreened search or a regular search. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Screening vs. Investigation</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>“The difference between screening and investigation is analogous to the difference between giving cholesterol tests to a large number of consumers for a medical risk factor for heart disease, versus doing an exploratory surgical procedure one patient at a time. Obviously an exploratory procedure is much more reliable, but it is also intrusive, time consuming and expensive. Of course, when giving merely a cholesterol test instead of performing exploratory surgery, it is possible that someone with a serious condition might slip through the cracks and have a more serious condition than indicted. However, the cost must be weighed against the benefit of faster, less expensive and less intrusive procedures that have an excellent detection rate on a greater number of people.”∗</p>
				<p>Research for the purpose of screening conventionally entails a seven to ten year search scope. </p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Search Logistics</a></dt>
			<dd>The details about the manner in which a search was performed—e.g., the date the search as completed; the jurisdiction it was performed in; the type of search performed; the Search Scope; the key identifiers with which the search was conducted; et cetera. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Search Scope</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<ol>
					<li>Of a search request: the period of time to be covered by that search, from starting date to through date;</li>
					<li>Of a search result: the period of time that was covered by that search, from starting date to through date.</li>
				</ol>
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Second Chance Deferral Program (Illinois)</a></dt>
			<dd>The second chance program is designed for first-time offenders who are willing to take responsibility for their conduct and want to keep a felony conviction off their record.  The defendant must complete an intake interview, take an initial assessment tool, and if accepted complete the requirements placed upon them by the State's Attorney's Office.  The requirements are tailored to each case but often include community service hours, obtaining a high school diploma or G.E.D., completing counseling, writing a letter of apology to the victim, paying restitution, holding a full-time job. If the defendant completes the program, the charges are dismissed with prejudice.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Sensitive Data</a></dt>
			<dd>Any information about the applicant obtained as a result of a verification or reference.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Seven-Year Search</a></dt>
			<dd>Historically the Seven-Year Search is the most common and predominately requested search product in the Background Screening Industry. However it is not the only product. The Ten-Year Search is probably the second most commonly requested search product. There can be varying search scopes beyond a Ten-Year Search, extending up to an unlimited search. Research providers typically base their default search rates upon a Seven- to Ten-Year Search product, and commonly charge a per-year surcharge to search beyond that. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">SING</a></dt>
			<dd>Iowa- The Single Contact Repository (SING) is an internet application developed and sponsored by the State Department of Administrative Services / Information Technology Enterprise that allows registered users to perform background checks on potential employees, volunteers, and students doing clinicals, from a single web screen. The application lets a user check Iowa criminal history, three abuse registries (child, dependent adult, and sex offender), and over 40 Public Health professional license types from one click on the screen.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Skill Survey</a></dt>
			<dd>An automated tool for gathering 360° assessments from job candidates’ managers, peers, subordinates, clients, and business partners. The software then tabulates and charts the results so that you can compare candidates’ suitability using empirical data.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Starting Date</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<ol>
					<li>Of an index: indicates how far into the past that index extends;</li>
					<li>Of a search scope: indicates how far into the past that subject was searched. (Compare with through date.)</li>
				</ol>
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Stricken Off Leave – Non-conviction</a></dt>
			<dd>Often seen in Illinois, the case has been stricken off docket with the ability to reinstate at a later date if deemed that the case can be prosecuted. This is often because the prosecutors run out of time to prosecute.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Strict Match</a></dt>
			<dd>At least two, and whenever possible three, matching subject identifiers are established. For example, a Name Match plus a DOB match would constitute a Strict Match (see Matching Logic).</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Strong Password</a></dt>
			<dd>A password that is difficult to detect by both humans and computer programs, effectively protecting data from unauthorized access. A strong password consists of at least six characters (and the more characters, the stronger the password) that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are typically case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase. Strong passwords also do not contain words that can be found in a dictionary or parts of the user’s own name.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Subject</a></dt>
			<dd>The applicant or employee on whom background information is being gathered. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Surcharges</a></dt>
			<dd>A research provider’s rates are typically based on their default search products. Surcharges may apply to additional services that extend beyond the depth, level or scope of their default search products (see enhanced search products)—such as an extended search; unlimited search; copies; rush requests; record retrieval requests; prescreened requests; pursuing possible records on common names; pursuing non-readily available records; rechecks not pursuant to a consumer dispute; et cetera. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Through Date</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<ol>
					<li>Of an index: indicates how near to the present that index extends, or the currency of that index;</li>
					<li>Of a search scope: indicates how near to the present a subject was searched. (Compare with starting date.)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The Through Date shall be sufficiently close to the provider’s report date so that the information is “complete and up to date” under the FCRA and applicable state law. </p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Title 15 U.S.C.</a></dt>
			<dd>The U.S.C., or United States Code, is a compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal law of the United States. The code is made up of 50 distinct sections or “Titles”. Title 15 pertains to Commerce and Trade, under which the FCRA is to be found at §1681 et seq. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Title 16 CFR</a></dt>
			<dd>The CFR, or Code of Federal Regulations, is the codification of the general and permanent rules and regulations published by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government of the United States. The code is made up of 50 distinct sections or “Titles”. Title 16 pertains to Commercial Practices. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Traffic Court Cases</a></dt>
			<dd>Traffic court cases are just that—cases that are filed in a traffic court as opposed to a criminal court. Although sometimes traffic court cases are included on a criminal index, they are traffic court cases all the same, and are generally considered unusable records in the context of a criminal search. A traffic court case however is not to be confused with a traffic-related criminal record. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Unlimited Search</a></dt>
			<dd>A search with a search scope that minimally constitutes the subject’s DOB plus 18 years. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Unreportable</a></dt>
			<dd>Not reportable. See Reportable.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Unusable Records</a></dt>
			<dd>Unusable records in the Background Screening Industry conventionally include: infraction cases; traffic court cases that happen to appear on a criminal index; and dismissed cases to some extent—although the latter should not be taken for granted as some customers may require dismissed records either be reported on or at least mentioned. </dd>
			
			<dt><a name="">Verification</a></dt>
			<dd>A step during the due diligence process in which a specialist will attempt to confirm the validity of claims made by an applicant concerning their criminal history, education, licensure or experience using information provided to the CRA by the consumer. Most Background Screening/Verification Companies are not conducting investigations but are providing verification services for the purpose of background screening.</dd>
