			using the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' E-Verify system to verify their employees'
			eligibility to legally work in the United States.<br />

		<h2>FCRA Compliance/Mandates Document Disposal</h2>
		<p>On June 1, 2005, a new administrative rule came into effect under the Fair and Accurate Credit
			Transactions Act (FACTA). This rule requires every employer that employs one or more
			employees to follow a disposal rule to shred any and all documents that contain information
			derived from a credit report.<br />

		<h2>Acquisitions</h2>
		<p>Business acquisitions and mergers are becoming a common method for 
			business expansion into new geographies or markets. All acquisitions involve the 
			integration of personnel into a new organization. There may be hidden liabilities 
			in the absorption of unfamiliar staff into a larger organization.<br />

		<h2>HIPPA Requirements for Healthcare Providers</h2>
		<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1996 required 
			the establishment of programs to combat healthcare fraud and abuse. As a part 
			of the program, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was given the authority 
			to levy civil monetary penalties against entities that submit claims for healthcare 
			services rendered by employees or contractors whom they know, or should 
			know, have been excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
			Penalties can be as high as $10,000 per infraction. Three infractions can lead to 
			permanent exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, the OIG can 
			impose an assessment of three times the amount claimed.<br />

		<h2>FBI Criminal Background Checks</h2>
		<p>Employers have increased the use of background checks to minimize the risk of 
			making a poor hiring decision. But the term 'background check' is broad and 
			often has many interpretations. A basic component of a good background check 
			is an investigation into an applicant's past to find criminal convictions.<br />

		<h2>OFAC Requirements for Auto Dealerships</h2>
		<p>OFAC stands for the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the US Department 
			of Treasury. OFAC manages and enforces economic and trade sanctions against 
			targeted foreign countries, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and weapons traders. 
			OFAC has the ability to freeze foreign assets under US jurisdiction.<br />

		<h2>Worker's Compensation Claims Check</h2>
		<p>Conducting an historical check of an applicant's prior worker's compensation 
			claims can be an effective background investigation component for some 
			positions. However there are a number of limitations that employers must be 
			aware of before requesting and utilizing this information. <br />

		<h2>Non-employee Background Checks</h2>
		<p>Many employers have implemented an effective pre-employment screening 
			program to minimize risk in their hiring process. However, employers still face 
			another important question. What about contractors, temporary workers, or 
			vendor personnel who have access to the workplace, business records, and IT 
			systems?<br />

		<h2>False Education Claims</h2>
		<p>The practice of lying in our society has become all too commonplace. In a recent 
			study 42 percent of young people said "a person has to lie or cheat sometimes in 
			order to get ahead." In a separate study, 95 percent of college-age respondents 
			were willing to lie to get a job. 41 percent reported that they had already done so. <br />
