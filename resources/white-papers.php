		<h2>The Benefits of Pre-employment Screening</h2>
		<p>by Alan Kinsey</p>
		<p>Employers face a number of human resource challenges. Recruiting the right employee for the right job is one of the most critical challenges, and that task has become more difficult with a global economy and very mobile workforce. Employers can no longer rely solely on candidate interviews to make a sound hiring decision. Pre-employment screening is a process that allows employers to verify information such as education, and prior job history and performance. In addition the screening process reveals important information about a candidate's prior behavior which can help an employer assess potential risk posed by the candidate. Prior behaviors can include substance abuse, credit history and bankruptcy, driving records, and criminal convictions, and civil litigation.</p>
