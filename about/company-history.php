		<p>In 1994, Jim Sweeney formed James M. Sweeney and Associates, Inc. to assist organizations in the management of losses associated with employee misconduct and other forms of risk. A former police lieutenant, Jim Sweeney built an organization with deep investigative expertise, technological excellence, and a commitment to superior service.</p>
		<p>The passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 created an opportunity for organizations to deploy a preventative strategy to combat employee misconduct in the workplace. Sweeney and Associates launched Inquirehire, a division dedicated to helping employers identify high risk candidates with thorough, fast, and compliant background investigations. A leader in the industry, Inquirehire was a founding member of the National Association of Professional Background Screeners (NAPBS).</p>
		<p>In 2007, Inquirehire launched one of the nations first pre-integrated applicant tracking and background screening solutions. With the Inquirehire solution employers can transform and optimize their hiring process to save time, money, and avoid hiring mistakes.</p>
		<p>Since its beginning, Sweeney and Associates have helped hundreds of organizations implement solutions that make their organization more effective and efficient while managing the risk of a poor hiring decision.</p>
